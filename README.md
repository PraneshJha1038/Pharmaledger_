## The Problem

India faces a critical healthcare crisis stemming from the proliferation of counterfeit medicines in the pharmaceutical supply chain. The counterfeit medicine industry is extensive and deeply embedded, posing severe risks to public health and safety across the nation.

### Key Challenges:

- **Counterfeit medicines constitute a serious and growing public health crisis in India.**
- **Between 12% to 25%** of pharmaceuticals in India are estimated to be fake or substandard.
- **Counterfeit and substandard drugs have surged by nearly 50% since the COVID-19 pandemic**, now making up around **15% of all medicines** sold.
- These fake medicines can be ineffective, harmful, or fatal, leading to treatment failures and increased antimicrobial resistance.
- **Lack of Centralization:** No unified platform exists for tracking and detecting counterfeit medicines across India's fragmented pharmaceutical distribution network.
- **Consumer Vulnerability:** Citizens cannot easily verify the authenticity of medicines they purchase, leading to consumption of potentially harmful counterfeit products.
- **Pharmacy Accountability:** Pharmacies have no systematic way to verify the authenticity of batches they receive, risking unintentional distribution of counterfeit medications.
- **Manufacturer Credibility:** Genuine manufacturers struggle to differentiate themselves and build trust with consumers in a market flooded with fakes.
- **Supply Chain Opacity:** The journey of a medicine from manufacturer to consumer lacks transparency, making it impossible to trace or identify where counterfeits enter the system.
- **Regulatory Enforcement:** Enforcement is often reactive with insufficient penalties, allowing counterfeit drug production and distribution to persist.
- **Economic Impact:** This problem imposes heavy economic losses on legitimate pharmaceutical manufacturers and healthcare systems across India.

## The Solution

PharmaLedger addresses these challenges through a comprehensive, three-tier digital ecosystem that brings transparency, accountability, and trust to pharmaceutical distribution using blockchain technology.

### How PharmaLedger Works:

**1. Manufacturer Registration & Verification**
Manufacturers register on the platform by providing genuine credentials (company name, manufacturing license number, issuing authority, expiry date, address, and other details). PharmaLedger team members manually verify this data against the State FDA database. Upon verification, manufacturers receive unique ID and password credentials to access their personalized dashboard.

**2. Batch Data Upload & Management**
Verified manufacturers upload batch data in CSV format containing mandatory fields (batch number, medicine name, expiration date, production date, quantity, etc.). The backend processes these uploads and stores the data in a centralized MySQL database. As the platform scales, manufacturers gain the ability to organize and manage their batch data within the platform, functioning as a cloud-based repository for their pharmaceutical inventory.

**3. Pharmacy Verification & Status Tracking**
Pharmacies register and undergo similar FDA verification. Upon receiving medicine shipments, pharmacies upload Excel files containing batch numbers. The backend automatically scans each batch number against the database and generates a status-marked Excel sheet with color-coded indicators:
- **Green:** Authentic and within expiration date
- **Red:** Counterfeit or not found in database
- **Orange:** Expired or approaching expiration

The system dynamically links each scanned batch to the pharmacy name, creating an auditable trail of the medicine's distribution journey.

**4. Citizen Authentication & Barcode Scanning**
Citizens access a simple, intuitive homepage where they can verify medicine authenticity through two methods:
- Manually entering the batch number
- Scanning the barcode on the medicine package

The system instantly displays whether the medicine is authentic, counterfeit, or expired, empowering consumers to make safe purchasing and consumption decisions.

### Key Benefits:

- **Trust & Transparency:** A centralized, blockchain-backed, government-aligned system builds credibility and public confidence.
- **Accountability:** Every stakeholder—from manufacturer to pharmacy to consumer—can trace and verify the medicine's authenticity.
- **Brand Enhancement:** Manufacturers and pharmacies build positive brand image by participating in a recognized anti-counterfeit ecosystem.
- **Public Health Impact:** Reduces counterfeit medicine circulation, improving treatment outcomes and public safety across India.
